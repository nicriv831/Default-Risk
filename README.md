My client's business does home loans for the unbanked. They collect a variety of traditional and non-traditional data that they use to make their approval decisions. They're looking to ensure the prospective borrowers with the best capability to repay are approved.

The population the client caters to are underserved in the financial world, and our client's goal is to help that undersevred population have access to resources they may not normally have access to. They also want to ensure loans are setup in a way that decreases the chance of a default.

I will analyze the various datasets provided by the client with the goal of creating a model that accurately predicts default risk.

The client has specified they want a model with the area under the ROC curve (ROC AUC) of at least .70 between the predicted probability and the observed target.
